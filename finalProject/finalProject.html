<!-- 
It is time to put your knowledge of JavaScript to work. 
Your WEB 115 JavaScript Project requires you to create 
an application for a fitness company. Form elements will 
be used to accept user input which will be assigned to variables. 
These variable values will make up the content of a new Web page 
that will be generated when a form button is clicked. This is called
 building a Web page "on-the-fly". I understand that you have not 
 turned in any assignments that are identical to this during the 
 course of the semester. That is precisely the point. You are now 
 required to think outside of the box and be creative! That is why 
 I'm allowing extra time for you to complete this work. I've provided 
 you with an example of how to create a web page on the fly. You can 
 find this invaluable example by scrolling to the bottom of this page.
  Look for the folder named "Project Resources".

<!--
1. Create an HTML document named finalProject.html. The title (tab) 
should read WEB-115 Final Project. 

2. Create a banner for your HTML form that includes your name, course, and section number. 
This banner should also include the words "Build Your Meal Plan". Format this banner professionally 

3. Create an external JavaScript document (with the .js file extension) named projectJS.js. '

4. The meal plan will display the users input for 5 meals (Breakfast, snack, lunch, snack & dinner) for the week 
(Monday â€“ Sunday). 

5. The user will have the ability to clear the weekly planner. User should also have the ability to print or download 
planner.

6. The application must collect the user's personal information name, email & goal for the week.  
Create a form button. When clicked this button should call a function that generates a new Web 
page displaying the meal plan based on the user input. Use the document.write() method to populate
the newly generated Web page with all of the HTML elements, formatting, and variable values needed
to produce the desired output in Web (.htm) format. HINT: a monospaced font will allow text wrapping
in your output. You may also provide for this using CSS. Important! No meal plan should be generated
until a proper email address is entered. This is the only validation requirement for this form.
